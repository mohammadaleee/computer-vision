Fruit Image Classification with ResNet-18

This project fine-tunes a pretrained ResNet-18 model to classify fruit images into six classes: fresh apple, fresh banana, fresh strawberry, rotten apple, rotten banana, and rotten strawberry.

Features

Transfer Learning: Uses pretrained ResNet-18 and trains only the final layer.

Data Augmentation: Random flips and normalization for better generalization.

Evaluation: Tracks training/validation loss and accuracy, generates confusion matrix and classification report.

Visualization: Plots of training/validation loss and accuracy per epoch.

Model Saving: Saves trained weights for later inference.
